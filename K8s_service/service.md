why we need service?

suppose lets assume there is no service. For example developer team of 3 members. You created the cluster and deployed the application on pod. And developers access the application using created pods.

user1 access the application 172.3.4.1
user2 access the application on 172.3.5.1
user2 access the application on 172.3.6.1

Suppose one of the pod go down or terminated. Again new pod will up with the new ip address. Users can't access the application. 
On top of deployment.yml file service will installed. service solves the above problem.

Service addresses the 3 solutions,
1.Load balancing
2.Service Discovery
3.Expose the application to internet

For every pods labels will be applied and label will be common to all pods.
Service act as the load balancer it uses the component called kube proxy. 
Service keeps monitoring using labels even though the ip address got changed.

whenever you creating service resources you've types modes:

1.clusterIP
  - Using cluster ip you will get load balancer and service discovery. Application accessed inside kubernetes
  
2.Nodeport
  - Node port mode will allow application accesses inside the organisation[who has accessed to worked node]

3.Loadbalancer
- Loadbalancer mode will expose the application to the internet. Elastic Load balancer ip address will be generated by cloud controll manager.
